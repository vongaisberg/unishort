    <h2>Welcome at ü§è.to, the shortest URL shortener in the world!</h2>
    Pronunciation: <i>Pinch Dot TO</i>
    It uses (most) of the Unicode space to produce 7 character URLs, much shorter then all the other URL-shorteners.

    <input type="text" id="url_long" name="url_long">
    <input type="submit" value="Shorten">
</form>
