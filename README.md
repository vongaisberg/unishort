# unishort
An URL shortener that uses (almost) the full Unicode range to create the shortest URLs possible.

The URLs created by this shortener are only seven characters long, about half as long as the URLs of bit.ly

## Todo
- [x] Proof of concept
- [x] Accept scheme-less URLs (google.com instead of https://google.com)
- [ ] Improve design
- [ ] Write an API specification (should be very easy)
